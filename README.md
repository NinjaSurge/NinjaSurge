# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëã Greetings! I'm @NinjaSurge.
I'm on a journey of learning.
I am a **VERY** big advocate for Open-Source Technology. As I think it helps the spread of knowledge (and by extension, learningüòÇ)

I'm doing a lot of learning in Web Technologies and Cyber Security as a whole.

I'm looking for projects that:
- Don't mind doing a little teaching or at least have some patience with a Noob.
- Are Web, Python, Bash, or Javascript related
- Anything Bible Related
- Anything that doesn't mind someone who has limited experience and is willing to learn.

## What I know
At-least the Basics of:
- [![NODE][node.js]][node-url]
- [![REACT][react.js]][react-url]
- [![MongoDB][mongodb]][mongo-url]
- [![SASS][sass]][sass-url]
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Vanilla HTML
- Vanilla CSS
- JSON
